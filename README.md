# The Tower
This project kicked off in February 2023 when three enthusiastic students, including myself, were inspired to revive the classic mini-game "The Tower" on a Minecraft server. Although the original concept is well-known, our vision was to inject new life into it. However, as the project progressed, two of my peers decided to step away, leaving me to carry the torch alone. Undeterred, I set my sights on creating a version of "The Tower" that not only pays homage to the original but also introduces a fresh perspective and faster gameplay, drawing inspiration from popular games like Hypixel's Bedwars.

# State of developpement
As of now, I'm in the final stages of completing the main game. The plugin is nearly at a playable state, aside from a few minor bugs that still need ironing out. Balancing the gameplay, such as adjusting weapon damage and the cost of items in the shop, will take a bit more time. However, rest assured, the plugin is on its way to being ready for testing soon! And eventually the plugin will be ready for testing!

# SpigotApi
A lot of the work is done indirectly by myself in my [SpigotApi](https://github.com/Lucaa8/SpigotApi) plugin and then used in the tower.
